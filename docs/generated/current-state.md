# Current Repository State

Last updated: 2026-07-27

## Status

### Built and manually verified
- Flutter candidate application scaffold
- Android debug APK GitHub Actions workflow
- Android APK installation on Samsung S24 Ultra
- Application launch without crash

### Current UI
- Phase 1.1 application foundation replaces the default Flutter counter demo
- Router-backed startup screen with loading, recoverable error, retry, and
  low-data-mode representations
- Phase 1.2 Material 3 design system with shared tokens and production widgets
- Development-only component gallery accessible from the startup screen in
  development and staging configurations
- No candidate onboarding, authentication, or production data flow yet

### Android configuration
- compileSdk 36
- targetSdk 36
- Java 17
- Gradle 9.1.0
- Android Gradle Plugin 9.0.1
- Kotlin 2.3.20
- Unused jni dependency removed

### Active branch
feature/flutter-foundation

### Latest verified milestone
Phase 1.1 application foundation complete. Phase 1.2 design system source,
analysis, and widget tests pass locally; the authoritative GitHub Actions APK
validation is pending for the Phase 1.2 commit.

### Phase 1.1 validation record
- `flutter pub get` — passed
- `dart format .` — passed; 25 files checked with no outstanding changes
- `flutter analyze` — passed with no issues
- `flutter test --reporter expanded` — passed; 4 tests
- `flutter build apk --debug` — attempted locally, but Gradle 9.1.0 exits
  before project settings evaluation with `The settings are not yet available
  for build`. This occurred before Dart or Android source compilation and also
  reproduced with Java 17 and the direct Gradle task. GitHub Actions remains
  the authoritative APK validator for this repository.
- GitHub Actions **Build Candidate Mobile APK** — passed for `e879e7d`:
  dependency resolution, static analysis, debug APK build, and artifact upload
  all completed successfully.

### Phase 1.2 implementation
- Brand, semantic colour, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, and icon
  tokens
- Accessible primary, secondary, text, destructive, loading, and disabled
  button states
- Shared text field, card, status chip, progress, and static skeleton widgets
- Empty, error, offline, pending-sync, bottom-sheet, dialog, and snackbar
  patterns
- Development-only component gallery covering every Phase 1.2 component
- Production configuration omits the component gallery route and entry point

### Phase 1.2 local validation record
- `flutter pub get` — passed
- `dart format .` — passed; 46 Dart files checked
- `flutter analyze` — passed with no issues
- `flutter test --reporter expanded` — passed; 13 tests
- Hindi text expansion — widget test passed at 320 logical pixels and 1.6x
  text scaling
- `flutter build apk --debug` — attempted locally and reached the unchanged
  Gradle build, which exited before project settings evaluation with the same
  documented Gradle 9.1.0 host error. GitHub Actions is the authoritative APK
  validator.

### Next implementation
After the Phase 1.2 GitHub Actions APK build passes, implement Phase 1.3 from
docs/20-codex-phase-execution.md: splash, welcome, language selection, and
sign-in choice using the shared design system.

## Known constraints
- Android/Termux/Ubuntu PRoot environment cannot reliably run Android SDK host binaries
- GitHub Actions is the authoritative APK build path for mobile-only development
- macOS will be required for iOS build and signing
- No external analytics, connectivity, authentication, or storage provider is
  connected in Phase 1.1; the included adapters are intentionally local mocks
- The component gallery is a development aid and is intentionally unavailable
  in production configuration
